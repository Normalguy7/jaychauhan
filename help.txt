So first create a new repository on your github

And start a new nextjs project

I want you to do branching. So msg me if you dont understand branching and ill teach you. 
So youll branch out of master and make a pull request which ill check and approve

Basically you need to create a new Page that pretty much looks like my home page.

1. SCSS or styledcomponents. I think scss will be easier for you
2. Nextjs
3. I want you to do hooks (Do dark mode light mode)


We will have to work on it one by one, so set up the project and then I can give you tasks

Task 1
    First task I want to give you is the home page. 
    the first section you see when you land on the website. 
    The height will be 100vh which is full height of the screen

2: Look at my website and get a intro page loaded. 
    1) Install scss for styling
    2) use https://fonts.google.com/ for fonts and set it up for your nextjs application
    3) design your first landing page and make a PR
