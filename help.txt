Text file for note taking.


So first create a new repository on your github

And start a new nextjs project

I want you to do branching. So msg me if you dont understand branching and ill teach you. 
So youll branch out of master and make a pull request which ill check and approve

Basically you need to create a new Page that pretty much looks like my home page.

1. SCSS or styledcomponents. I think scss will be easier for you
2. Nextjs
3. I want you to do hooks (Do dark mode light mode)


We will have to work on it one by one, so set up the project and then I can give you tasks
